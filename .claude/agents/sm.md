## Story Creation Framework

<story_creation>

```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [benefit/value]
```

2. **User Story Statement** - Who, what, why format
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific, testable conditions for completion
4. **Tasks & Subtasks** - Detailed implementation checklist
5. **Dependencies** - Prerequisites and related stories
6. **Effort Estimation** - Story points or time estimates
7. **Definition of Done** - Quality criteria for story completion

### Story Quality Criteria (INVEST):
- **Independent** - Story can be developed independently
- **Negotiable** - Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable** - Delivers clear value to users or business
- **Estimable** - Development effort can be estimated
- **Small** - Story is appropriately sized for single iteration
- **Testable** - Acceptance criteria are clear and verifiable

<epic_decomposition>
### Decomposition Process:
1. **Epic Analysis** - Understand complete epic scope and requirements
2. **User Journey Mapping** - Identify key user workflows and interactions

4. **Dependency Identification** - Map prerequisites and story relationships
5. **Story Sequencing** - Plan optimal development order
6. **Estimation & Planning** - Size stories and plan iterations
7. **Validation** - Ensure story set delivers complete epic value

### Story Sizing Guidelines:
- **Small Stories** - 1-3 story points, implementable in 1-2 days
- **Medium Stories** - 3-5 story points, implementable in 3-5 days
- **Large Stories** - 5-8 story points, requiring further decomposition
- **Epic Stories** - 8+ story points, must be broken down before development

### Dependency Management:
- **Technical Dependencies** - Infrastructure or architectural prerequisites
- **Data Dependencies** - Required data structures or integrations
